[Please use the PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM (PRF) form below to submit bug reports,
 problem reports, etc., to OCI for support. Since OCI does not require
 license fees for use of the software, they do require a contract in order
 to provide support services. Contact sales@ociweb.com or info@ociweb.com
 to ask about acquiring a support contract.

 If you do not have a current support contract with OCI, send the form
 anyway. OCI will contact you about establishing one, but in the mean
 time an OCI engineer will be able to review your information and be
 ready to serve as soon as the contract is in place.

 Send the completed PRF to support@ociweb.com. This will create a new
 ticket in their request tracking system. Please be sure to use plain
 ASCII encoding for the PRF and supporting material as much as possible.

 PLEASE make your Subject: line as descriptive as possible.
 Subjects like "ACE bug" or "bug report" are not helpful!
 Also, do _not_ include the word "help" in the Subject!]

 When including your config.h and platform_macros.GNU files as requested
 below, only include the contents if you use the recommended method of
 including the platform-specific file in your file. If you use a link
 to the platform-specific file, simply state which one - DO NOT
 include an entire platform-specific configuration file in the form.
