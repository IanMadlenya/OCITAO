This is TAO version 2.3a_pre, _not_yet_released_

This is a modified version of the TAO originally released by the DOC group.
It contains additional fixes and optimizations. An overview of OCI's version
of ACE and TAO is available in the $ACE_ROOT/OCIReleaseNotes.html file. Many
of the the changes have been included in the current versions of TAO released
by the DOC group.

Since TAO is open source and free of licensing fees, we do not derive any
revenue other than through our services and support. Therefore we are unable
to provide free support.
