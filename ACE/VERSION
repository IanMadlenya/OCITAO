This is OCIACE version 6.3a_pre, _not yet released_

This is a modified version of the ACE originally released by the
DOC group.  It contains additional fixes and optimizations.
An overview of OCI's version of ACE is available in the
ACE_wrappers/OCIReleaseNotes.html file.

Many of the the changes have been included in the current versions
of ACE released by the DOC group.

Since ACE is open source and free of licensing fees, we do not
derive any revenue other than through our services and support.
So, unfortunately, we are unable to provide free support.
